1.0.0
5/9/2020

Initial release

1.0.1
5/18/2020

Moved some definitions out of .h files so that SchedTask.h can be used in .cpp files.  Otherwise duplicate definitions occur.

1.0.2
7/4/2020

Corrected SchedBase.cpp which was not handling setNext(NEVER) correctly.

1.0.3
7/7/2020

Changed the dispatcher to fix exposure to millis() overflow at 49 days.
Previously the library would fail at that point.

Now it should work provided any task scheduled in the future is less than about 24 days hence.

1.0.4
8/18/2020

The IDE Library Manager was not showing the latest version number.
Corrected library.properties and set the Tag to 1.0.4.

1.0.5
8/20/202013

Use linked list rather than vector for task list.
Added support for task iterations to limit dispatches.
Added Example_10 and Example_11 to illustrate use of iterations.
Expanded documentation in comments in SchedTask.h and SchedTastT.h.

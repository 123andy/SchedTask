# SchedTask
Task Scheduler Library for Arduino

The Task Scheduler Library simulates multi-tasking without the use of interrupts, enabling your sketch to handle multiple asynchronous tasks simultaneously. For example, you can easily blink two LEDs with different durations and periods at the same time.

The library is easy to use and includes examples. Only basic C++ programming skills are needed to take advantage of it.

A detailed tutorial on YouTube provides all you need to know to get started. It presents several example sketches that illustrate various ways to use the library. It deliberately starts out very basic in order to enable even beginner programmers to use it.
